I believe I have the necessary skills for this position!
<!--more-->

I believe that I have the necessary skills and interests to pursue this traineeship. I have made this website from scratch using hugo themes, and deployed it on netlify via github. **Yes, I enjoy website creation.** This website surprisingly took a lot of time since I was constantly running into deployment issues. At one point my website was ready and so was the content and everything was running smoothly on my local server; however, there were tons of issues I could not resolve. I even started working on a Google site leaving behind the lovely theme, since the content was ready; however, on the morning of 21s February, I decided to give it another try and set it up from scratch again, this time very carefully and with hopes it goes live and **YES**, it goes live! YAY! 

While conducting interviews might not be my greatest strength, I believe with a good plan and strategy, I can have a nice and smooth conversation revolving around the topic and creating one great compilation of memories. 

Finally, I have designed content for this website and many previous projects through Canva. I  have good knowledge about the use of Canva as well. I have also made the video recording and edited it via lumafusion (I was not able to add proper effects since I was running out of time for the traineeship application deadline).

I am also ready to put in the extra effort if I am required to learn something new for this traineeship!

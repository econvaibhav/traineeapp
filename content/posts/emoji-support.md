Here are some of my motivations to work for this position
<!--more-->

I am really motivated to work for this position. Keeping aside all the complex reasons, I can boil my motivation down to three simple reasons: 
1. My interests, 
2. Paid opportunity,
3. Ends 30th June and is a 4 month long project. 

Let us begin with my interests. Ever since I was young, I was always fascinated with content creation – be it making YouTube videos or creating blogs and websites. At present, I have one running website, which I update regularly. On this website, I post content relating to myself, my interests and, even pictures of my hobbies and trips Here is a link to the website [My Website](https://vaibhavagarwal.org/.)

I have also written an entire website which has a coding theme
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hosted it through git pages. Here is a link to the Github Repository and here is the link to the Website.  [Git Repository](https://github.com/econvaibhav/vaibhavagarwal) and [Website](https://econvaibhav.github.io/vaibhavagarwal/)

Aside from my interests in basic web development, I have also made Youtube content for NGOs. Here is a link to some of the videos I have previously made:

1. On E-Learning:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33QMJL6DroI]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33QMJL6DroI)
2. On Mental Health:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U54RdeYz2l]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U54RdeYz2l)

Additionaly, I have also really enjoyed talking to you and an opportunity to work under you seems really exciting and something I would surely enjoy. 

This brings me to my second reason: paid opportunity. Despite having come from India with money to live in Helsinki for a year, thanks to my family, an opportunity to earn money to support my living costs would be extremely beneficial to me financially. It will also help me make healthier choices, enjoy eating food I like and at restaurants every once in a while, as well as to save money to visit nearby places! 

Finally, since this is a four month long traineeship, it helps me in 4 additional ways:


1. Not having to worry about finding a job or traineeship for the year and being able to solely concentrate on my studies and master’s thesis

2. It will also give me enough time (hopefully) to be able to learn Finnish basics, which will help me look for part-time jobs requiring basic Finnish next year. 

3. These 4 months will also give me time to learn and develop new skills which are useful for my thesis and I can devote my entire time to them.

4. It also ends on 30th of June which is a great time to head back to India and visit my parents before the second year starts!

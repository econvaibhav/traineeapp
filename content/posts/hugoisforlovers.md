Here is a bit about me. 4 sections was looking odd :)
<!--more-->

To be honest, I believe this section was not required. We have had so many interactions, and I have talked about myself, as well as have had interesting conversations with you on Friday Coffee sessions. The main reason for me to include this section was to maintain the layout of the website, i.e., 1, 2+2 format, and I was unable to think of what to include in the last section, hence, here we go – this is a section, well, about me.

I thought it would be interesting to give this section a twist! I have been learning Finnish for some months now and I guess I can take up the challenge to write a short introduction about myself in Finnish without using chatGPT and only taking help from google translate when necessary !!

> Moi! Minä olen Vaibhav Agarwal. Minä olen 21 vuotta ja Minä tykkään

Nähdään, ensi perjantai 
Moi moi.
